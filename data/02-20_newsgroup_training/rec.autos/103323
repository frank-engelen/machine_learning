I am interested in finding out how the 4Runner and Pathfinder have
been updated in the past few years.  Like new engine, suspension and
the like.  I noticed that the 1993 and 1992 4Runners are identical,
for example, and was looking into buying a used one.

Any info would be appreciated, esp. models/years to check out or
avoid.

Thx, Andy (brandt@cs.unc.edu)
